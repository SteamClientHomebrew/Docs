# Introduction

Why do we need a backend and a frontend? Simply put, you don't. Most of the code that interacts with steam will be done in Javascript. The backend and frontend are symbiotically intended to seamlessly connect between the 2 languages. The backend is primarily used whenever you need to interact with the user's PC, and the frontend is primarily used to interact with the Steam Client internally. 

## [Python API](/developers/plugins/python)
- Obviously, the Python API is accessible in python. It's intended to provide some boiler plate functions to make getting started easier so you don't need any prerequisite understanding.
- Main file `backend/main.py`


## [TypeScript API](/developers/plugins/typescript)
- Again, obviously, the Javascript API is accessible in JavaScript. It's intended to provide some boiler plate functions to make getting started easier so you don't need any prerequisite understanding.

- Main file `frontend/index.tsx`
