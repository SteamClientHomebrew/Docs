# Publishing

## Prerequisites

- [Getting Started](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/Millennium/wiki/Creating-Themes)
- [Theme Template Repository](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/Themes)

## Introduction

In order to publish a theme to the community store, you must have your theme in a GitHub repo where the `skin.json` is in the root directory of the repository. Copy the structure of [this template](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/Themes) repository if you're confused.

## Guidelines
As you've probably seen from other themes, the README.MD file in you GitHub repository is displayed in the view panel when a user views your theme
. Any of the following in the README will result in your theme being taken down.

**Not Permitted:**
- NSFW Content
- Political Content
- Gifs/Images involving real people
- Talking about anything other than you're theme
- Any fully paid services 

**Permitted:**

- Advertising Discord Servers, Support servers, donation links

## Submitting

Ensure that you have all required JSON keys in the `skin.json` as specified in [Getting Started](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/Millennium/wiki/Creating-Themes)

Once you have your theme ready to go you can ping a moderator/developer in the discord server 
https://millennium.web.app/discord

**If your theme is approved, it will be put on the community store**
